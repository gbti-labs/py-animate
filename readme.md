# Py Animate Hue

This script allows the user to create an animation from a still image by shifting hue, brightness, and contrast in a simple programatic way.

## Project Structure
- `animate.py`: The main script for processing images.
- `inbox/`: Folder containing sample images for processing.
- `presets.json`: File containing predefined settings for image processing.

## Sample Images
- `python-sample-a.png`
- `python-sample-b.png`
- `python-sample-c.png`
- `python-sample-d.png`

_The following mp4 was generated with the "huegolong" preset which rotates hue 360 degrees over 920 frames:_

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`, typically including:
- [Pillow (PIL Fork)](https://python-pillow.org/) - The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities.
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) - A Fast, Extensible Progress Bar for Python.
- [imageio](https://imageio.github.io/) - A Python library for reading and writing image data.

## Installation
To install the required libraries, use the following command in your project's root directory:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Script
To start the image processing, run the script from your command line:
```bash
python animate.py
```

### User Interaction and Inputs
Once the script is running, it interacts with the user through the command line interface (CLI) to collect the following inputs:

1. **Image Selection**:
   - The script lists all images in the `inbox` folder.
   - You will be prompted to enter the number corresponding to the image you wish to process.

2. **Using Presets**:
   - If presets are available (defined in `presets.json`), you can choose to apply one.
   - The script will list available presets and ask if you wish to use one.
   - Selecting a preset applies predefined settings for hue, brightness, contrast, and number of frames.

3. **Custom Settings**:
   - If not using a preset, you can customize the following settings:
      - **Hue**: Define the start and end hue values (range -180 to 180). This changes the color tone of the image.
      - **Brightness**: Set the start and end brightness levels (range -100 to 100). This affects the lightness or darkness of the image.
      - **Contrast**: Adjust the start and end contrast values (range -100 to 100). This alters the difference between dark and light areas of the image.
      - **Number of Frames**: Determines the smoothness and length of the animation (higher number for smoother animation).

### Understanding the Settings
- **Hue Shift**: Alters the color spectrum of the image, creating visually dynamic effects.
- **Brightness Adjustment**: Useful for creating a transition from dark to light or vice-versa.
- **Contrast Modification**: Enhances or reduces the sharpness and clarity of the image.
- **Number of Frames**: Affects the duration and fluidity of the resulting animation. A higher number results in a longer and smoother animation but increases processing time.

After these inputs, the script processes the selected image and saves the animated result in the `outbox` folder either as a **gif**, **mp4**, or both depending on user direction.

## Features
- Adjust hue, brightness, and contrast of images.
- Generate animated image transitions in GIF and MP4 formats.
- Use preset configurations for consistent effects.
- Interactive CLI for selecting and processing images.

## Configuration and Presets
- `presets.json` contains predefined settings.
- You can create custom presets or modify existing ones.

### Preset Examples:
- `huego`: Cycle through the color spectrum in 30 frames (good for a gif)
- `huegolong`: Same as huego but for 920 frames. (better for a mp4)
- `darktolight`: Gradually increase brightness.
- `contra`: Enhance contrast over time.
- `party`: A combination of color and contrast changes for a party-like effect.
